    <h2>A+ Certified MIN Alchemist</h2>
    <p>
    Good Morning.  "I'm Clovis Bordeaux.  I do technical support services related to computer networks and software, and networks.

    An  innovative technology champion consistently developing solutions in educational and business settings.  An avid hands-on teacher/learner comfortable in networking and software environments, with experiences in building responsive and interactive websites and applications.  
    
    I adapt easily to challenging situations. I enjoy learning new technologies and devising strategies to solve problems. I have found that paying close attention to detail produces high-quality work the first time, and that keeps me from having to do it again. I try to understand your needs, goals, and frustrations  to engineer a path forward.I have the communication skills to explain complex situations or processes and make them simple to understand..
    
    I help companies accomplish their goals faster and cheaper than they ever thought possible.  I make sure technology works for you instead of against you."
